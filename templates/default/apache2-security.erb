# ServerTokens
# This directive configures what you return as the Server HTTP response
# Header. The default is 'Full' which sends information about the OS-Type
# and compiled in modules.
# Set to one of:  Full | OS | Minor | Minimal | Major | Prod
# where Full conveys the most information, and Prod the least.
#
ServerTokens Prod

#
# Optionally add a line containing the server version and virtual host
# name to server-generated pages (internal error documents, FTP directory
# listings, mod_status and mod_info output etc., but not CGI generated
# documents or custom error documents).
# Set to "EMail" to also include a mailto: link to the ServerAdmin.
# Set to one of:  On | Off | EMail
#
ServerSignature Off

#
# This directive overrides the behavior of TRACE for both the core server
# and mod_proxy. The default TraceEnable on permits TRACE requests per
# RFC 2616, which disallows any request body to accompany the request.
# TraceEnable off causes the core server and mod_proxy  to return a
# 405 (Method not allowed) error to the client.

TraceEnable Off
